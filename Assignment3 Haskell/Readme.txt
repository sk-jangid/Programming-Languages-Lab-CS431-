Question3
I have implemented this by assumming that all the components of given type will have sam dimensions and dimensions can be increases by only increasing it to both dimensions.

Here are the function description 

	->design S b h - Space S , b-deroom count, h-hall count, Give Solution which has optimized useful space. Print dimension of each component in optimized solution
